This repo was an experiment in splitting parts of BRiAL.
The code here is not usable without a sagemath (https://www.sagemath.org/) install.
The useful code is now completely included in sagemath and you shouldn't use this repo.

BRiAl is the legacy version of PolyBoRi maintained by sagemath developers.

pyBRiAl is the python implementation of BRiAl.

It aims to be usable with python2.7 and python3.4 and over.
